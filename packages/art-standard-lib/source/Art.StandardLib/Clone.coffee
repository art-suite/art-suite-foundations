2018-07-27 SBD Notes

I want to move towards:

  clone: is a combination of stuctural clone and calling .clone, if available. Otherwise, it doesn't do what I'm calling invasive-cloning.
    invasiveCloning: false
    customCloning: true
    recusiveSafe: fully
    Note: ArtAtomic objects have .clones that return new objects, however, ArtAtomic objects are designed to be used in a read-only way,
      so this is a waste most of the time. UNLESS you intend to modify the cloned object, which sometimes you do need to do.
      So, that's why cloneStructure is often the right answer - it won't clone non-plain-objects

  cloneStructure: clone only plain-object and arrays. Everything else is just a simple assignment.
    invasiveCloning: false
    customCloning: false
    recusiveSafe: stack - (See below)

  invasiveClone:
    invasiveCloning: false
    customCloning: false
    recusiveSafe: full
    (cloneByProperties basically did this)
    Deeply clone everything, manually cloning objects regardless if they have a .clone method.

---
This current iteration of clone relies on some singleton variables shared across all invocations of clone.
This is fine as long as javascript stays single-threaded.
It also introduces a little bit of uglyness initializing clonedMap necessitating the "top" variable.

FUTURE
A potentially better solution would be to create a new closer each time clone is called at the top-most level,
but when recursing, pass in a new function bound to that closure which is different from the global clone function.

populateClone would need to take an additional argument - the clone function to use for recursive cloning.

  ###
  clones plain objects and arrays, but not any other type

  FEATURES
    - no allocations beyond the newly crearted object and arrays

  recursiveSafe: uses a stack
    This means:
      NO two objects or arrays in the output structure will be "==="
      UNLESS they were in a (grand)parent/(grand)child relationship in the source.

      This means if you have the same (===) object/array more than once in the structure,
      in a non (grand)parent/(grand)child way, each use will get a separate cloned output
      in the new structure. In other words

    This as a nice advantage: the output is JSON-compatible.

    This is mostly a performance optimization. It allows us to avoid any extra object allocations.
    Once we can safely use the new ES6 Map everywhere, we might perf-test again to see if full
    recursion-safety isn't just as fast.
    But then we lose JSON-compatible output guarantees...
