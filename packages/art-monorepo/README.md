# art-monorepo

A simple wrapper for [@art-suite/monorepo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@art-suite/monorepo).

This package provides the same functionality as `@art-suite/monorepo` but with a simpler package name. It's useful if you want to use the monorepo tools without the organization prefix.

## Usage

```bash
npx art-monorepo [command]
```

This is exactly equivalent to running `npx @art-suite/monorepo [command]`. See the [@art-suite/monorepo documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@art-suite/monorepo) for available commands and options.
