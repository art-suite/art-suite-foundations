It is an opinionated tool with one core design principles:\n\n- All packages in the monorepo should use the same version of any external dependencies.\n\nGiven that principle, it follows that there should only be one package-lock.json file and one node_modules/ folder - in the root of the entire monorepo.\n\nArt-monorepo is also explicitly auto-opinionated, compared to other monorepo tools, in that we believe the folder structure of your monorepo should be up to you. Art-monorepo simply looks for any package.json file in any sub-folder when performing its tasks.\n\nThe main usage of art-monorepo is running the \`art-monorepo sync\` command followed by an \`npm install\`.\n\nArt-monorepo also has handy tools for running all tests and any shell-command of your choices in all packages in the monorepo.\n\nVersion: ${Caf.toString(require('../../package').version)}`, commands: require('./Commands')});}};})();});
